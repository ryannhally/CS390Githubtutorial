# Welcome!
Welcome to my Git from the command line tutorial!

Git is a **version control system** for developers. In other words, Git allows you to manage changes to code. Once you master Git, you will be able to use it to track changes to your code and collaborate more easily with other developers, among other things.

In this tutorial will cover the basics of using Git from the command line. You will learn how to...
* Create a repository
* Commit
* Branch
* Merge

## Getting Started

1. Open a command line

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To work with Git from the command line, you will first need to open up your terminal of choice.
  
2. Install Git
  You can check to see if Git is already installed by running
   ```
   git --version
   ```
If you don't already have Git installed, click [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/how_to_install_git/index.html) for a tutorial on how to install.
 
3. Authenticate
```
gh auth login
```

## Create a repostiory
First, we will create a repository on the command line. Of course, this is not the only way to start working with Git ....

### Create a local repository
Move into whereever you'd like your project to be stored and run
```
git innit
```

### Create a remote repository
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/your github username /your github repo name.git
```
